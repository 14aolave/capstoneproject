This is my first post on my new travel blog! How exciting!

My name is Angie and my passion is to travel, its what I was born to do and now being a mom, my job is to show my kids the world. 

I am originally from Colombia and moved to the states with my mom and sister when I was 7 years old. Left everything behind in search of the "American Dream". I was in the medical field since I was in High School, I hit a road block and stumbled upon Tech. It has changed my life, looking forward to building my career in Tech.

> My family is my American Dream. They are the center of my world. 
> Nothing better than traveling the world with my world.
